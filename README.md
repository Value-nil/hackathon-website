# hackathon-project
A project for hackathon

The project itself is a website which uses OpenAI API to ask ChatGPT about how to archieve something(such as becoming developer). It also includes a motivational message generator.

Thanks to Angell131 and BTParadox for working with me. It was enjoyable the whole time.
